//! The `omaha_client::time` module provides a set of types and traits to allow for the expressing
//! of time using both a wall-time clock, and a monotonic clock.
//!
//! The motivation for this is that wall-time is subject to being artibtrarily moved (forwards or
//! backwards as the system's timekeeper decides is necessary), to keep it in sync with external
//! systems.
//!
//! The monotonic clock, on the other hand, provides a consistently moving forward notion of time,
//! but one that is not anchored at any particular external point in time.  It's epoch is therefore
//! somewhat opaque by nature.  Rust's std::time::Instant takes this to the extreme of making the
//! underlying value completely hidden from callers.
//!
//! One aspect of the `TimeSource` trait and the `ComplexTime` type is that they provide a way to
//! pair the two timelines, and construct a time that is given in terms of each of these dimensions.
//!
//! What it doesn't try to do, is so that these pairings are the _same_ time.  They can be
//! observations made concurrently (as in the case of `TimeSource::now() -> ComplexTime`),
//! or they can be bounds for when an event in the future can happen:
//!
//! ```
//! use omaha_client::time::{ComplexTime, MockTimeSource, TimeSource, Timer};
//! use omaha_client::time::timers::MockTimer;
//! use std::time::{Duration, SystemTime};
//! let past_event_wall_time: SystemTime = SystemTime::now();
//! let source = MockTimeSource::new_from_now();
//! let duration_to_next = Duration::from_secs(1*60*60); // one hour
//! let rough_next_event_time = ComplexTime{
//!                               wall: past_event_wall_time + duration_to_next,
//!                               mono: source.now_in_monotonic() + duration_to_next
//!                             };
//! let mut timer = MockTimer::new();
//! timer.wait_until(rough_next_event_time);
//! ```
//!
//! The above setups up a `ComplexTime` as a bound that based on an expected wall time, and
//! monotonic time relative to `now`, such that the event can be described as "at time X, or within
//! an hour" when used with `Timer::wait_until`, or "after time X, at least an hour from now", if
//! used with `Timer::wait_until_all`.
//!
//! # Usage Guidelines
//!
//! The `ComplexTime` and `PartialComplexTime` structs give the ability to represent a number of
//! states of knowledge about a time.
//!
//! When modeling the known time for something:
//!
//! * `ComplexTime` - When both wall and monotonic times are always known
//! * `PartialComplexTime` - When some time (wall, monotonic, or both) is always known
//! * `Option<ComplexTime> - When time is either known for both timelines, or not at all.
//! * `Option<PartialComplexTime> - Situations where time can be in any of 4 states:
//!   * None whatsoever
//!   * Only wall time
//!   * Only monotonic time
//!   * Both are known
//!
//! When modeling the time required (e.g. timer waits):
//! * `ComplexTime` - When both wall and monotonic times are always required
//! * `PartialComplexTime` - When some time (wall, monotonic, or both) is always required, but any
//!   or both will suffice.
//!
