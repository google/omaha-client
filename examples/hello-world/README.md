# Hello World (for the omaha-client-lib)

This is a minmal demo application to show how a client would use
the [omaha-client-lib](https://github.com/google/omaha-client) to
communicate with the update server.

It is intentionally kept very simple, to illustrate how
to set up the state machine and keep watching for updates.

It is recommended to start reading through `main.rs`, where
a step-by-step documentation can be found to guide through this
example.
